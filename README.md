## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

Legal, policy, regulatory, and academic documents are often long, complex, and filled with dense, technical language. These documents typically span **hundreds of pages**, requiring readers to manually search for key information such as **obligations, deadlines, penalties, definitions, and decision points**.

Professionals such as **lawyers, founders, compliance officers, journalists, and researchers** routinely face the challenge of extracting actionable insights from these documents under time pressure. Traditional tools are inefficient, and manual reading is slow, error-prone, and mentally taxing.

There is a clear need for an intelligent system that can:
- Quickly process and understand a wide variety of document types  
- Extract structured, relevant, and critical insights  
- Enable contextual interaction and querying of the document  
- Present information in a concise and shareable format  

**NoLegalese.ai** addresses this gap by transforming complex documents into simplified, structured reports and enabling instant Q&A-style interactions for deeper understanding — all within seconds.
